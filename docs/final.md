With this project, we were aiming to help University of Maryland students choose General Education classes quicker. The stakeholders consist of UMD students with unfulfilled GenEd requirements. Our target devices were laptops and computers with larger screens, but mobile devices are still supported. We chose to work with UMD course data provided by [umd.io](https://umd.io/). We decided to make our application work as a search engine; filtering the results of the data available based on input by the user. This felt easy to navigate by the user as well as felt like something that could be developed in the time that we had available. Our final system helps the problem by allowing users to search by topics (which is not supported by [Testudo](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/)) and showing the number of open seats available in each section. We could not get the application to filter by GenEds, which decreases its usefulness. Future designs should have this feature, as well as having the results presented in a cleaner manner.
