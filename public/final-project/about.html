              Hello!
              <br>
              This is a group project made as a requirement for INST377. Using the umd.io API, we wanted to make finding courses that will fulfill GenEd requirements easier, since they all seem to be taken up quickly. Our hope is that you will be able to use this application to make more informed decisions about what classes to take when registration period arrives.
