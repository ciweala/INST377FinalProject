    On the Homescreen, you want to type in the requirement that you need to fulfill (FSWA, for example). The application will then return a list of courses that fulfill that requirement, as well as the professor teaching and the number of open seats available. 
    If you click on one of the courses, it will display extra information that you may need to know before picking the course, including a description of the course, any prerequisites, and the number of credits it fulfills.
